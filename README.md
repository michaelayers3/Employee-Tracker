 ## Installation
To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:
            
```
npm i
```
The package.json file included in this repository already has all the dependencies you need, so you can just run npm i to install them all at once. In case you need to install them individually, here are the dependencies you need:
* inquirer
* mysql
        
 ## Usage
 This application is run in the command line. To start it, run the following command:
            
 ```
 node index.js
 ```
 Then, follow the prompts to view and manage your company's departments, roles, and employees. The user can create files with seed data to populate the database, and can also add new departments, roles, and employees, as well as update existing employees' roles.
